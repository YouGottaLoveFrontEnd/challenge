# Front End it's all about Code, Design and Behavior.

## Overview
"Front End it's all about Code, Design and Behavior" - my submission for the YGLF challenge.
The idea is to describe the areas in which the Front End developer deals every day during his work in a Creative and pleasant way..
In fact it is a fully responsive landing page based on a Parallax slider with CSS transitions, SVG animation, tons of graphic design and love.

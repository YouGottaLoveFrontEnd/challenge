## Front End it's all about Code, Design and Behavior.

## Overview
"Front End: it's all about Code, Design and Behavior" - is my submission for the YGLF challenge.
The concept is to illustrate the areas that the Front End developer deals with every day in a creative way...
It's a fully responsive landing page using a Parallax slider with CSS transitions, SVG animation, tons of graphic design and love.
